# Event-time input modifiers

Portable source input already transports Shift, Control and Alt with each event.
`PortableWindowActivationService` now scopes that aggregate over the complete
synchronous input report, including capture routing and routed source callbacks.
`Keyboard.Modifiers` therefore observes the event snapshot, not a keyboard cache
that may have changed while a native pointer event waited for dispatch.

Nested pointer, keyboard and committed-text events each select their own snapshot.
Unwinding restores the outer snapshot, including after exceptions. It never rolls
back the physical key cache: a real key-up delivered during a pointer callback
stays released afterwards. Aggregate flags do not establish left/right key
identity or replace individual key/toggle queries. Windows/Super remains excluded
from `Keyboard.Modifiers`, matching the existing native source policy; the host's
Command-to-Control translation remains separate.

The stack-only scopes allocate no per-event heap object, require the source
thread, and reject out-of-order or stale release. Unknown aggregate flags fail
before scope publication. Native Windows devices retain their original modifier
query, and public API signatures do not change.

`eng/progpu-wpf-input-modifiers-source.sh` runs actual routed pointer, wheel,
nested key/text and exception tests, then the device-level cache/lifetime tests.
It runs in the existing Linux source-contract CI job, after the original source
framework test assembly is built. This is source input evidence, not native
Cocoa popup admission, capture cancellation, precise scrolling or application
qualification; those remain separate integration work.
